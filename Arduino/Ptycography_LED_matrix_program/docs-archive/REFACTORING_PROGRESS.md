# Ptycography LED Matrix Controller - Refactoring Progress

> **Historical Note (April 2025)**: This document tracks the original refactoring progress. The structure described here has been updated to a flat directory structure. See `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE.md` for current documentation status.

This document tracks the progress of refactoring the Ptycography LED Matrix Controller from a monolithic design to a modular architecture.

## Completed Components

### Models
- ✅ `PatternModel`: Manages LED patterns and generation algorithms
- ✅ `SystemStateModel`: Manages application state (running/idle/simulation)
- ✅ `CameraModel`: Handles camera settings and trigger state

### Controllers
- ✅ `AppController`: Central controller coordinating application components
- ✅ `UIManager`: Manages UI components and user interaction

### Views
- ✅ `MatrixView` (original version using observer pattern)
- ✅ `MatrixViewRefactored` (updated version using event system)
- ✅ `StatusPanelView` (original version using observer pattern)
- ✅ `StatusPanelViewRefactored` (updated version using event system)

### Utilities
- ✅ `EventSystem`: Publisher-subscriber pattern for component communication
- ✅ `ConfigManager`: JSON-based configuration storage and retrieval
- ✅ `SerialManager`: Handles communication with Arduino hardware

### Main Application
- ✅ `Refactored_CentralController.pde`: New main file using modular architecture

## Components Requiring Attention

### Main Application
- ✅ `CentralController.pde`: Now contains the refactored modular application structure
- ✅ Original monolithic implementation preserved as `CentralController.pde.original` for reference
- ✅ Example file renamed to `Refactored_CentralController_Example.pde.reference`
- ⏳ Test the refactored application thoroughly

### Views
- ✅ Created event-based versions of MatrixView and StatusPanelView 
- ✅ Integrated refactored views with the event system
- ⏳ Standardize view initialization and layout
- ⏳ Remove the original observer-based views when testing confirms functionality

### Documentation
- ✅ `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Overview of modular architecture
- ✅ `TEST_PLAN.md`: Comprehensive test plan for verification
- ⏳ Full code documentation with consistent comments
- ⏳ User manual updates for the new architecture

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Component Creation [COMPLETE]
- Create modular components (models, views, controllers, utilities)
- Implement event system for communication
- Create parallel implementation alongside original code

### Phase 2: Integration and Testing [IN PROGRESS]
- Integrate components in a new main application file
- Test components individually and in integration
- Verify feature parity with original implementation
- Address compatibility issues

### Phase 3: Transition [PENDING]
- Switch main application to use new architecture
- Remove deprecated components
- Complete documentation
- Finalize testing

## Testing Status

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | Note |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|------|
| Models | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | Core functionality validated manually |
| Views | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | Visual verification needed |
| Controllers | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | Behavioral verification needed |
| Utilities | ✅ EventSystem | ✅ ConfigManager | Core utilities verified |
| SerialManager | ⏳ Pending | ⏳ Pending | Requires hardware for full testing |
| Main Application | ✅ Basic Init | ⏳ Pending | Created test script |

## Known Issues

1. Observer pattern and event system currently coexist - need to standardize on event system
2. Original views need to be fully replaced with refactored versions
3. Documentation needs to be completed for all components
4. Testing framework needs to be implemented
5. **Processing subdirectory limitations**: Processing doesn't fully support Java-style packages, which causes issues with our modular structure. Solution implemented:
   - Created a simple flattening script that copies files to a flattened structure with prefixed names
   - Established coding standards that ensure compatibility with Processing's constraints
   - Updated development workflow to maintain both modular and flattened versions

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve the Processing structure limitations**: ✅
   - ~~Created a flattening script (`flatten.sh`) to generate a Processing-compatible version~~
   - ~~Created a flattened version in `CentralController_Flat` folder~~
   - Implemented prefixing convention (`Model_`, `View_`, etc.) to maintain organization ✅
   - Fixed all `color` type declarations to use `int` instead for Processing compatibility ✅
   - Created coding standards and incorporated them into main README.md ✅
   - ~~Added automated fix script `fix_color_types.sh` for future maintenance~~

2. Run the test script to verify basic functionality of the refactored application ✅
3. Fix any issues found during testing ✅
4. Add proper error handling for edge cases (disconnection, invalid parameters) ✅
5. Implement comprehensive testing according to the test plan ✅
6. Remove deprecated observer-based views and rename refactored views to remove the "Refactored" suffix ⏳
7. Finalize documentation for all components ✅
8. Perform regression testing to ensure feature parity with original application ✅

## Flat Directory Structure Implementation - April 2025

To simplify the development workflow and better align with Processing's limitations, the structure has been further improved:

1. ✅ **Direct Flat Structure**: 
   - Abandoned the dual-structure approach (development vs flattened)
   - Moved all code directly to a flat directory in `Processing/`
   - Removed the need for flattening scripts and maintenance of dual structures

2. ✅ **Processing Compatibility Improvements**:
   - Systematically fixed all compatibility issues
   - Corrected parameter naming to avoid reserved words
   - Implemented static enums as required

3. ✅ **Documentation Consolidation**:
   - Combined all documentation into a unified README.md
   - Updated all file paths and references
   - Created DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE.md to provide a clear picture of current status

The project now has a simpler, more maintainable structure that works directly with Processing while retaining the modular organization through consistent naming conventions.
